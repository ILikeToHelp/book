# Requirements for Computer Science jobs board

We are replacing moodle with a new web application to advertise jobs vacancies to students in Computer Science.

## Key Requirements (essential)

1. Authorised administrators can post new vacancies using an admin interface
2. Only students can search and browse vacancies, by using their CAS login details https://login.manchester.ac.uk
3. Each job vacancy will have a unique URL that can be linked to e.g. http://jobs.cs.manchester.ac.uk/some-identifier

4. Students will be able to subscribe / unsubscribe to notifications (initially email) of new vacancies
5.. The application will work on mobile (e.g. tablet and smartphone) both macOS and Android, alongside a desktop version of the application
