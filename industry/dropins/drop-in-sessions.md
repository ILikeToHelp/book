# Drop-in sessions in the School of Computer Science

At the School of Computer Science, University of Manchester, we schedule regular drop-in sessions at peak times through the academic year allowing companies direct access to our students.

The sessions are informal and held over a lunch period, in a busy area where students are going to and from the labs, lecture theatres and Byte café on the lower first floor. These sessions take place during term time see [http://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/key-dates/](http://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/key-dates/)

We will help support the promotion of your drop in session, using our virtual learning environment and notice boards, plasma screens etc. Any suitable text, posters etc you provide can be used.

For the session we can provide tables, chairs, web access etc (with prior notice). If you wish to bring specialist equipment we will be happy to discuss your requirements with you. Materials can be sent in advance to us directly if you wish.

# Directions and parking
We are based in the Kilburn Building, http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/about-us/find-us/. A full campus map can be found at http://www.manchester.ac.uk/aboutus/travel/maps/ The Kilburn building is number 39 on that map.

If you are travelling by car, the nearest public car par is the [NCP Aquatic Centre](http://www.ncp.co.uk/find-a-car-park/car-parks/manchester-aquatic-centre-jv/). At times this can get  busy, if you struggle to get a space you could try parking at Booth Street car park, located near the Royal College of Music (RNCM).

If you are travelling by train, the nearest stations are Manchester Piccadilly or Manchester Oxford Road.

From Piccadilly station the Kilburn building is approximately 20 minutes walk. A taxi is approx 5-10mins. A direct bus - [service 147](http://www.route147.co.uk/map-timetable/) is also available from the station.

From Oxford Road station we are approx 10mins walk.

The main street level entrance is located to the left of the building (with the precinct centre/Blackwell’s book shop behind you). As you come through the entrance there is a desk with a phone to your right. Please call (internal number 50140) a member of our team meet you. For those who are familiar with our building please proceed directly to LF26.

We can promote your drop in session; however it will be up to your team to engage with the students once you are here. It may be useful to have some visual interaction, perhaps a laptop showing your latest project, pop up stand, leaflets; goodies etc all help draw attention.
