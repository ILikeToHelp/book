# A.1.7 Describe how employability skills are developed within the students

We help students to develop employability skills, defined as five core skills  [careers.manchester.ac.uk/myfuture/](http://www.careers.manchester.ac.uk/myfuture/)

##Curricular

* **First year** the module COMP101 includes a series of 20 [guest lectures](http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/industry/guest-lectures/) given by external employers to give an overview of the wide range of careers available to computer scientists. As part of the course, students write reflections on their group work. Towards the end of the first year, the Managing My Future (MMF) program, covers basics of CV writing with peer and self-assessment of CVs. This CV is continuously updated through the degree.

* **Second year** starts  with careers a workshop, students who have been on placement give short presentations on their work to kick start the placement application process for students. As part of COMP234 (Software Engineering), all second years are assigned an industrial mentor twice during the year, once at the beginning of the project at the University and a second time (often on site with the employer) to gain insight into the realities of modern software engineering. Placements (and graduate positions available) are advertised centrally online [http://www.careers.manchester.ac.uk/careerslink/](http://www.careers.manchester.ac.uk/careerslink/) and locally via an email alerts system exclusively for Computer Science students at Manchester.

* **Placement year** we encourage all students to consider doing a placement year or a summer internship, whatever their particular degree program. Currently between one quarter and one third of second year students secure year long placements

* **Final year** we encourage students to propose their own final year projects, if they don't want to choose a ready-made project proposed by an academic member of staff.  A significant number of final year projects are industrially co-supervised or completed with a third-party (e.g. schools based final year projects)

##Extra-curricular

* **Careers fairs and drop-in sessions** In the school we have two major careers fairs which run in the School, one for larger employers in October followed by a smaller fair in March for local SME's. There are also two centrally organised careers fairs that recruit graduates generally, we publicise these events as and when they happen as well as external events like [siliconmilkroundabout.com](http://www.siliconmilkroundabout.com). We invite companies to drop-in sessions which run all through term time, where employers exhibit their company in the central atrium.

* **Competitions, Hackathons & External events** We co-organise and promose an extensive series of hackathons and competitions, staff vs. student programming competition, [HackSocMCR](https://twitter.com/hacksocmcr) events, Major League Hacking [MLH.io](http://MLH.io), [Barclays BBC UniTech Challenge](http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/about-us/news-and-events/full-article/?articleid=3454), [HackManchester.com](http://www.hackmanchester.com), [studenthack.com](http://www.studenthack.com) and the annual [ACM Programming Competition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACM_International_Collegiate_Programming_Contest). We publicise local tech events the [Monday Mail](http://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/ugt/mondaymail/) when they are relevant to students, see e.g. [technw.uk/calendar](http://technw.uk/calendar)

* **Alumni and networking**  we host alumni events around twice a year in the evening with food and refreshments. These include speed networking with alumni [your.manchester.ac.uk/current-students/meet-the-professionals](http://your.manchester.ac.uk/current-students/meet-the-professionals). We have an informal social network on LinkedIn which we systematically invite students to join [http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=3782151](http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=3782151). We publish a list of placement students and their destinations (with students permission) so that students can contact peers who have applied to similar companies.

* **Volunteering** We encourage students to consider voluntary work, e.g. education & activities, schools liason [cs.manchester.ac.uk/volunteering](http://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/volunteering) and the [Peer Assisted Study Sceme (PASS)](http://www.pass.manchester.ac.uk) a facilitated, group learning opportunity that uses the experiences of higher year students to support the learning of their lower year peers.
* **Kilburn internships and Activities bursary** we offer around 15 technical summer internships within the school every year, which often serves as a students first work experience. We provide activities bursary fund which can be applied for to kickstart activities. This has funded e.g. studychina program, going to WWWDC conference in the USA and attending technical events in Netherlands.
