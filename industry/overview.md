# A.1.7 Describe how employability skills are developed within the students

We help students to develop employability skills, define as five core skills shown below  [careers.manchester.ac.uk/myfuture/](http://www.careers.manchester.ac.uk/myfuture/)

1. **Explore** the ability to stretch and self-improve, constantly trying new things to find out strengths and weaknesses
2. **Connect** networking with employers and alumni to learn about careers
3. **Communicate** Learn to write CVs, conduct interviews, deliver presentations and how to communicate in a professional manner, both in person and online.
4. **Reflect** thinking about what has been learnt & the skills that are developed
5. **Apply** having the courage to apply for jobs and for other opportunities to learn about themselves or careers; learning to deal with setbacks and rejection

These employability skills are developed as part of undergraduate degree course, with support from the careers service and augmented by an extensive program of extra curricular activities throughout the year
