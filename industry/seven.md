# Seven things to do at CERN if you're not a Physicist

There's plenty to see and do at CERN. Even in you're not a Physicist, there is lots to see above and below ground at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). Home to the worlds largest experiment on what is arguably the worlds largest machine near Geneva in Switzerland, CERN a very inspiring place to visit. Consequently, CERN features in many guidebooks like [The Geek Atlas](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-geek-atlas/9780596802257/) [1], the [Atlas Obscura](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cern), [Lonely Planet](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/switzerland/geneva/attractions/cern/a/poi-sig/409720/360817) and [Tripadvisor.com](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g188057-d242814-Reviews-CERN-Geneva.html]. So what can you do at CERN?

1. **Get a job in engineering**. Good news for engineers, there's loads of jobs at CERN. If you're a student see [careers.cern/students](https://careers.cern/students) for details on summer internships and year long technical student programs. There is also [careers.cern/professionals](https://careers.cern/professionals) for more experienced engineers. CERN's mission is to "[unite people from all over the world to push the frontiers of science and technology, for the benefit of all](https://communications.web.cern.ch/strategy/communications-architecture-vision-mission-and-themes)". Part of that means providing opportunities for people from [CERN's 23 member states](https://home.cern/about/who-we-are/our-governance/member-states) to learn new skills at CERN and take them back to their home country. CERN employs armies of engineers which means that for every research physicist at CERN, there are ten engineers. [2] To run their experiments, physicists rely on massive, novel and a very precise network of machines made with millions of parts, both moving and stationary. There are mechanical engineers developing heating & cooling systems and mechatronics. Materials engineers test novel materials, magnets, superconductors, use metallography, microscopes, vacuums, X-ray diffraction and apply radiochemistry. Software and hardware engineers develop applications, virtualised infrastructure, distributed computing and databases using a wide range of programming and scripting languages. Electrical and electronic engineers work on energy distribution, signal processing, microelectronics and radiofrequency technology. Last but not least civil engineers develop structures, both above ground and underground to accommodate all of the above.

So CERN is full of all kinds of engineers. But if you're not a physicist or an engineer looking for a job, there is still plenty to see and do, so lets re-start our list at number 1 again: Seven things to do at CERN if you're not a physicist (or an engineer):

1. **Watch cosmic rays arrive from outer space**: There are two main permanent exhibitions which can be visited without booking. One is housed in the aesthetically pleasing [Globe of Science and Innovation](https://visit.cern/globe) (GoSI), it's called the [Universe of Particles](https://visit.cern/exhibitions/universe-particles). Another is opposite and [Microcosm](http://microcosm.web.cern.ch/en). There’s plenty to see here, including film projections, [spark chambers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spark_chamber) showing cosmic rays and [cloud chambers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_chamber) which allow you to visualise [ionizing radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionizing_radiation).
1. **Wander the Immeasurable with Gayle Hermick** Right outside the GoSI, sits a very impressive sculpture made of 15 tonnes of twisted steel, stretched out over 37 metres and up 11 metres into the air. Covered in equations describing physics, it tells the story of physics from ancient Mesopotamia and Greece up to present day Higgs Boson in Europe and beyond. It's a beautiful work of art by [Gayle Hermick](https://www.gaylehermick.com/cern).
1. **Crunch numbers using Einsteins famous equation**. You can’t visit CERN without crunching some numbers. Many people will be familiar Einsteins famous equation of [mass–energy equivalence *E=mc²*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass%E2%80%93energy_equivalence). What this means that energy can be turned into mass (and vice versa) and the “exchange rate” (*c²*) is a very large number - the [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light) squared. So, you can turn a small about of mass into a HUGE amount of energy. Armed with your [handy mass–energy calculator](https://www.omnicalculator.com/physics/emc2), you can crunch numbers, for example 1 kg = 90,000,000,000,000,000 Joules.
1. **Thank the technology mothership**: CERN is [where the web was born](https://home.cern/science/computing/where-web-was-born), which we should all be thankful for. Engineers at CERN have also made [significant contributions to touchscreen technology](https://cds.cern.ch/record/1248908?ln=en) via the capacitive screens in use as early as 1973. [3] Cloud computing has some of its roots in [Grid Computing developed at CERN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cj8ZNgnzSSU) too. [4] Key pieces of widely-used open source software like [Ceph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceph_(software)) and [OpenStack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenStack) have been developed at CERN too. Where would we be without massive international collaborations?
1. **See the first accelerator** In 1957, the first particle detector at CERN fit on the back of a large lorry. Today it spans 27 miles of France and Switzerland. How did that happen? The [synchro-cyclotron](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/synchrocyclotron) tells the story of CERN before it was big and how it got big. Using lights and projectors, the exhibition brings the story to life in an illuminating way.
1. **Boggle at the big data (and big numbers)** Data speaks louder than words. Numbers speak louder that words too. Here are some random numbers and data for your mind to boggle on. Some of the detectors observe up to 40 million events *per second*. The LHC Grid computing generates 30 petabytes per year, with . The big loop is 27km long, travelling close to the speed of light, a proton laps the circuit 11,000 times *every second*. There are 100,000 scientists from over 100 countries working at CERN. The list goes on, see [facts and figures about the LHC](https://home.cern/resources/faqs/facts-and-figures-about-lhc) More boggling can be done in the data centre, see [Key Facts and Figures – CERN Data Centre](http://information-technology.web.cern.ch/sites/information-technology.web.cern.ch/files/CERNDataCentre_KeyInformation_December2019V1.pdf). If you want to vist the data centre then you can ...
1. **Book a tour** While the permanent exhibitions at the GoSI require no booking, tours do. They fill up quickly and provide access to other parts of CERN such as the [ATLAS experiment](https://atlas.cern/discover/about) and [CERN data centre](https://home.cern/science/computing). Very limited underground visits are possible during the shutdown of the Large Hadron Coller (LHC). [5]


If you ever get the chance to [visit.cern](http://visit.cern/), it is well worth it and not just for physicists and engineers.
<!--etc. I’m told the control centre is fun, and obviously it would be great to see some of the detector hardware up close but you can only do this when it is turned off. There I’ve been lucky in that all my tour guides have been technical students and their managers, thanks have some tour guides to show me around,

<!--but virtual tour https://www.google.com/maps/@46.251492,6.0209859,0a,112.6y,316.16h,78.31t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1s8VugZaYh_4BFWjYlKHvt8g!2e0?source=apiv3-->
