## Outline of the Mentoring Scheme

We are looking to recruit volunteers from industry to act as mentors to teams of undergraduate students studying [Software Engineering in their second year](https://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/ugt/COMP23420/syllabus/). This is the only compulsory course in the second year, with around 200 students every year. The aim of the scheme is to increase the industrial relevance of the course unit for our students by giving them access to an industry professional who can discuss (amongst other things):

* The range of career options available to graduates with particular flavours of Computer Science degrees.
* The realities of being a software engineer in today’s industry.
* The skills and knowledge needed to compete effectively in the current jobs market and to succeed in the future.
* Typical tools and techniques used by software teams.

Mentors will primarily interact with their teams by coming into the University to work face-to-face with students for one or two sessions, although other forms of communication are also possible.  We propose to ask mentors to meet with their teams twice in one semester, with an optional third encounter at the end-of-semester assessment showcase.

## What Will Mentors be Signing up to?

The academic year at Manchester is divided into two 12 week semesters:

* Semester 1: running from early September to mid-December.
* Semester 2: running from early February to early May (with a three week vacation over Easter).

The mentoring scheme will run twice in each academic year, once in each semester.  This means that mentors can sign up for just semester 1, just semester 2, or both semesters, depending on their availability.

Within a single semester, we ask mentors to interact with their teams at the following times:

* **Week beginning 22nd February 2016** (week 4 of teaching), we’ll ask mentors to come into the University to meet with their teams and kickstart the mentoring relationship during this week.  By default, mentors will come to the University for a 2 hour period, during which time they will spend an hour with each of two teams assigned to them.
* **Week beginning 18th April 2016** (week 9 of teaching): we’ll ask mentors to come to the University for a second meeting with their teams during this week.  Ideally, mentors will be able to come for a 2 hour visit, and will meet with the same two teams they met in week 4.  However, we recognise that this commitment might be difficult for mentors to make, and therefore we’ll offer a number of other options for this second meeting.  If a mentor cannot visit the university in week 8, they can:

  * Arrange a face-to-face meeting with their teams at some other mutually convenient time and place.
  * Arrange to hold an electronic meeting with their teams.
  * Arrange for a colleague from their organisation to meet with their teams in their place.

* **Week beginning 2nd May 2016** (week 11 of teaching): mentors can optionally attend the end-of-semester assessment showcase sessions, in which teams will present their work from across the semester.

<!--note that in semester one this date is week 12 - not week eleven-->


## What are the benefits to employers of mentoring?

Mentoring could be beneficial to employers in several ways, including advertising their company, building relationships with students, and - importantly - improving the quality of the entire cohort by helping to embed good software practices early on.

An optional showcase session at the end of the semester will provide an opportunity for mentors to assess all the teams presenting (other than their own mentees), which will provide contact for employers with a wider group of students for recruitment.


## What Will Mentors Do During the Visits?

We will ask our students to take the initiative in asking questions and posing topics for discussion, and will give them guidance in preparing to get the most out of their mentor’s time.  But we’ll also give mentors a “crib sheet” detailing issues that the students are currently facing, just in case a mentor has to deal with a particularly shy team.

Mentors can discuss their own personal experiences in the software industry, as well as giving careers advice and help in preparing for job applications and the recruitment process.  They can describe the toolsets in use in their own and other organisations, and the skills needed of a good software engineer.  They can talk about different software processes and dealing with team working challenges.

Mentors can also provide technical help, subject to the following important caveat:

We ask that mentors don’t make any attempt to help students directly with their assessed coursework, for this or any other course unit.

It would naturally lead to an unfairness in the assessment process if some teams receive direct help from an experienced and talented industry professional while other teams do not.  More importantly even that than, we want our students to become independent problem solvers, who are not fazed by a seemingly difficult challenge.

Mentors can help students by suggesting how they might go about looking for a solution if they were working in a real team, rather than by giving answers directly.

## What if Mentors Want to Offer More?

We know from your contributions at the Industry Club meeting that many of you are prepared to be very generous with your time, and would be willing to engage in contact with your team in between the meetings outlined above.  This contact could be by e-mail or by Skype, for example, or even (as some members were suggesting at the meeting) by inviting the team to visit your organisation.

We’ll be very grateful for any additional contact mentors propose to have with their mentees, and will facilitate these kinds of interactions where we can.  However, we won’t expect this level of contribution from all mentors, and will make sure that our students know not to hassle mentors in an irritating and unsolicited way.

## Preparing Mentors for the Scheme

There will be a [training workshop for mentors on Thursday 21st January from 10am to midday](https://cs-mentor-training.eventbrite.co.uk), where we will provide further details about the cohort and course unit, and there will be the opportunity to ask questions and raise any potential issues. We will also ensure that mentors have full access to all the teaching materials that the students receive.
