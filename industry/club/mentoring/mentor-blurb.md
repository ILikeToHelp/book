With the help of our industry club members, we have recently designed & delivered a completely new and innovative course to teach software engineering to second year Computer Science students at the University of Manchester. During the course, over 200 students work in small teams of six over a twelve week period with the support of a professional software engineer who mentors the team.

During the course, students build, test, modify and refactor a multi-user, multi-threaded, client-server application called Stendhal https://stendhalgame.org. Stendhal is a Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG) that has over 6000 Java classes, 1800 JUnit test cases and over 10 years of commit history. For many students, it will be the largest software project they have worked on to date as they make the challenging transition from greenfield software development to brownfield development.

As part of the course, students use a standard toolchain of Eclipse, Git (GitLab), JUnit, Mockito, Apache Ant, Jenkins, Gerrit and SonarQube to manage build automation, test automation, issue tracking, version control and code quality. The course has been designed specifically to prepare students for the realities of modern software engineering.

As of October 2016, the course has been taken by over 400 students (two cohorts of second year students) and we've had around 50 different mentors from a wide range of employers including ARM, Avecto, the BBC, CDL Software, CodeThink, Code Computer Love, DataCentred, Digital Bridge Ltd, EGN Digital, Farm Digital, IBM, Imagination Technologies, Morgan Stanley, NCC Group, On The Beach, Rental Cars, Sage Group plc, ThoughtWorks, Web Applications UK and Zuhlke.
