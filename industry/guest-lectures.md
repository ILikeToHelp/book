# Guest lectures in the School of Computer Science

The school hosts a number of guest lectures from our collaborators in industry and academia. There are five main ways that guest lectures can be done:

  1. Scheduled lectures for [COMP101](https://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/ugt/COMP10120/syllabus/), a first year course with 200+ enrolled students. For the academic year 2015/6, these talks take place from 11am to 11.50am in Lecture Theatre 1.1 in the Kilburn building
  2. [School research seminars](http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/our-research/seminars/) arranged by Professor Robert Stevens
  3. Technical talks arranged as part of a schedule module or course, [speak to the course leader for the relevant course](http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/about-us/staff/).
  4. Drop in sessions
  5. One-off talks arranged *ad hoc* that are not part of scheduled series of lectures, for example tehnical talks about [Life at Google](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_YQw3gyfOVGB4C0HAM89eREGTJ95GSMwnCv48UWws1s/edit?pli=1), [http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/about-us/news-and-events/full-article/?articleid=188](engineering at twitter) and Digital Media the BBC
