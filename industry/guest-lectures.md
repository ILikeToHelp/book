# Guest lectures in the School of Computer Science

The school hosts a number of guest lectures from our collaborators in industry and academia. There are five main ways that guest lectures can be done:

  1. Scheduled lectures for [COMP101](https://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/ugt/COMP10120/syllabus/), a first year course with 200+ enrolled students. For the academic year 2015/6, these talks take place from 11am to 11.50am in Lecture Theatre 1.1 in the Kilburn building
  2. [School research seminars](http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/our-research/seminars/) arranged by Profesor [Robert Stevens](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~stevensr/)
  3. Technical talks arranged as part of a schedule module or course, [speak to the course leader for the relevant course](http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/about-us/staff/).
  4. Drop in sessions
  5. One-off talks arranged *ad hoc* that are not part of scheduled series of lectures, for example tehnical talks about [Life at Google](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_YQw3gyfOVGB4C0HAM89eREGTJ95GSMwnCv48UWws1s/edit?pli=1), [http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/about-us/news-and-events/full-article/?articleid=188](engineering at twitter) and Digital Media the BBC

For COMP101, recent guest lectures have included American Express, Apadmi, Professor [Dave Cliff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Cliff_(computer_scientist)), Network Rail, NCC Group plc, the BBC,  CodeThink, Code Club, IBM, Morgan Stanley, Manchester Girl Geeks, ThoughtWorks, Web Applications UK, ARM Holdings plc, Imagination Technology and the Hut Group. Some example guest lectures for COMP101 are shown below to give a flavour of the kind of talks that are appropriate

We are always looking for good speakers who can engage large groups of students on interesting topics that they care about and relate to Computer Science. If you would like to propose a guest lecture, please contact [Duncan Hull](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~hulld/). There are a limited number of guest lecture slots (around 20) which run through [term-time](http://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/key-dates/) on Thursdays at 11am starting in November and finishing in early June. Its important that the lectures are much more than just a sales pitch for an organisation, they should have some content that relates to the [(very broad) syllabus of COMP101](https://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/ugt/COMP10120/syllabus/).
