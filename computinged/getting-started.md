# Getting started with computing education projects

If you are starting a [final year undergraduate project in computer science education](https://goo.gl/z9Hs9x), here are some useful resources to help get you started with your project and keep you going throughout the academic year. You can link directly to this document using the shortcut [git.io/computinged](http://git.io/computinged)

> “Our top priority was, is and always will be education, education, education”

... can you work out which political leader said this and when?

## Joining in
If you haven't already, join [Computing At School (CAS)](http://www.computingatschool.org.uk). CAS is UK network of teachers of computing in primary and secondary schools with lots of free resources available that you can re-use and extend, see [computingatschool.org.uk/sign_up](http://www.computingatschool.org.uk/sign_up). The University of Manchester is a [CAS Regional Hub](https://twitter.com/cas_manchester), so you've got some expert teachers in the Kilburn building who can help you, [Dave Ames](https://twitter.com/davidames), [Sarah Zaman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarah-zaman-85a4aa52) and Carol Murray.

It is important to get [DBS cleared](https://www.gov.uk/disclosure-barring-service-check/overview) which can take time, the earlier you apply the better, then you won't be waiting around at the beginning of term for your clearance before you can get stuck into your project. When you are DBS cleared, schools can be more confident that it is safe for them to let you work with children and young people (e.g. you are not a criminal). One of the easiest ways to do this is [sign up as a STEM ambassador](https://www.stem.org.uk/stem-ambassadors/ambassadors)


## Planning and thinking about your project in advance

Like many research projects, your final year education project is open-ended. Unlike lectures and exams, you have much more scope for driving the project in a direction you want, with help and guidance from your academic supervisors, the teachers in your school and the students and pupils you are working with. In previous years, undergraduate student projects have typically been one of the following kinds:

1. **DEVELOPMENT FOR STUDENTS** Creating an artefact or artefacts (e.g. software, hardware, lesson plans & resources) to help students understand different aspects of computer science
2. **DEVELOPMENT FOR TEACHERS** Creating an artefact or artefacts that helps teachers to teach and assess computer Science including what they have understood or misunderstood
3. **RESEARCH ON PEDAGOGY** Evaluating different methods for teaching, known as [pedagogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedagogy). For example, you might want to find out which kind of language is best for students learning about loops. Are text-based languages (like Python or Java) better or worse than block based languages (Like [Scratch from MIT](https://scratch.mit.edu) and [Blockly from Google](https://developers.google.com/blockly)) See the [ new research in computer science education 2015-2017](http://community.computingatschool.org.uk/files/8842/original.pptx) via Sue Sentance at King's College London & Neil Brown at the University of Kent

These categories are not exclusive, so you might do one or several of these together using the same tool.

## Essential reading and resources

You really need to look at these:

* Subscribe to [Hello World magazine](https://helloworld.raspberrypi.org/helloworld). Electronic copies  are free, but as an educator you can also sign up to have a glossy printed copy of the magazine sent to your postal address. The [MagPi magazine](http://magpi.cc) from the Raspberry Pi Foundation is similar,  though covers broader themes education alongside the frequently updated [Raspberry Pi blog](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/)

* You must read [Shut down or restart?](https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/computing-in-schools/report/) which was a landmark report published by the Royal Society (the UK's national academy of science).  Led by Professor [Steve Furber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Furber) here in the School of Computer Science in 2012, it provides a good overview of some of the problems facing computing education in the UK, that is part of the wider [Computing education at the Royal Society](https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/computing-education/) activity. The Royal Society will also publish [another major survey of computing education in schools in September 2017](https://royalsociety.org/news/2016/10/launch-computing-education-schools-survey/)

* **CAS Tenderfoot** is a Google-funded project that trains [Key Stage 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_Stage_3) teachers. Their training notes have loads of good ideas for teaching everything from finite state machines and graphy theory, to going beyond simple algorithms, see
[CAS Tenderfoot](https://www.computingatschool.org.uk/custom_pages/148-tft-available)

* **GCSE Computing** Even if you're not teaching GCSE Computer Science, it is useful to be able to understand what GCSE computing is all about as some of your students may be opting to take it in the future. See [BBC Bite Size](http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/subjects/z34k7ty) and [Cambridge GCSE Computing](https://www.cambridgegcsecomputing.org)
* Read [An overview of the Computer Science curriculum in secondary schools](http://www.computingatschool.org.uk/data/uploads/ComputingCurric.pdf) published in 2012
* **Project Quantum** [Project Quantum](https://diagnosticquestions.com/Quantum) provides a lots of high-quality diagnostic questions you can use to assess learning during your teaching [Project Quantum: tests worth teaching to](
http://community.computingatschool.org.uk/resources/4382) also [Bebras challenges](http://challenge.bebras.uk/)

* **Raspberry Pi** Lots of good teaching resources from raspberry pi https://www.raspberrypi.org/resources/teach/

* **CAS TV** The [CAS TV channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/computingatschool ) on YouTube has lots of useful stuff

* Education, and computing education, is frequently discussed in the mainstream media, such as  [bbc.co.uk/news/education](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education), some more specific examples below:
    * Rory Cellan-Jones (2017) [Computing in schools - alarm bells over England's classes](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-40322796), *BBC News*
    * Rory Cellan-Jones (2016) [Computing GCSE 'leaves girls and poorer students behind'](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-38364076), *BBC News*

## Using novel and unusual hardware

Taking hardware into the classroom that students may never seen before is a good way to spark interest. Try experimenting with new hardware that you could use in the classroom, we have lots of kit you can use in the [hardware library](http://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/ugt/hardware/?view=ug) like:

* [CodeBugs](http://www.codebug.org.uk) wearable technology
* [Micro:bits](http://microbit.org) an embedded system distributed to all schools in the UK by the BBC
* [Lego Mindstorms](https://www.lego.com/en-gb/mindstorms) and many other cheaper robotics kits
* [Oculus Rift](https://www.oculus.com) and [Google Cardboard](https://vr.google.com/cardboard/) Virtual Reality (VR) and [Augmented Reality (AR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality) will be completey new to many school students
* [Physical computing](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/announcing-our-new-online-training-series) going beyond your desk and phone
* [Artificial Intelligence](https://aiyprojects.withgoogle.com) Many people will familiar with Alexa from Amazon, Siri from Apple and “*OK Google*” see AIY projects (DIY Artificial Intelligence) from Google [aiyprojects.withgoogle.com/voice](https://aiyprojects.withgoogle.com/voice/)
* [Internet of Things (IoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things), wireless sensor networks and other embedded or distributed systems


## Unplugging: Computing without computers and cross-curricular links
Fancy hardware and gadgets are great ways to engage children, but you don't always need it. You can inspire people's imagination about computer science without using a computer at all, or by using computers in different settings Some good examples:

* [Computer Science unplugged (csunplugged.org)](http://csunplugged.org) from [Tim Bell](http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/tim.bell/) at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand is a Google funded project providing “engaging games and puzzles that use cards, string, crayons and lots of running around.”
* See [Computing Without Computers: A Gentle Introduction to Computer Programming, Data Structures and Algorithms](https://teachinglondoncomputing.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/booklet-cwc-feb2014.pdf) by [Paul Curzon](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~pc/) at Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) and his accompanying Computer Science for Fun website and magazine at [cs4fn.org](http://www.cs4fn.org)
* A key part of Computer Science education is [computational thinking (CT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_thinking). For your projects, think about what CT means and how you can encourage students to think computationally

You can also demonstrate the breadth of computing by building cross-curricular links via art, music, physics, chemistry and geography etc

* **Music** [Sonic Pi](http://sonic-pi.net) is a live coding music sythesiser and see [Getting Started With Sonic Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/getting-started-with-sonic-pi/) It started on the Raspberry Pi plaform, but now works on Windows and Macs too

* **Art** using computer generated imagery, you could borrow ideas from the second year course [Computer Graphics and Image Processing: COMP27112](http://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/syllabus/?code=COMP27112) or the third year [Advanced Computer Graphics Course: COMP37111](http://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/syllabus/?code=COMP37111)

* **English** what better way to teach literacy and english language than [creating a Shakespearean Insult Generator with Python](http://teachwithict.weebly.com/shakespearean-insult-generator.html)? There are lots of possibilities in this space

* **Physics** Teach waves and sound with [Audacity](http://www.audacityteam.org), Acceleration with cars and sensors see [racefortheline.com](http://www.racefortheline.com) or the electromagnetic spectrum using [Infra red cameras](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/pi-noir-camera-v2/)

* **Biology & Chemistry** teach students about the analysis of Genes, DNA and proteins in [their genomes](http://www.yourgenome.org) using algorithms, aka [Bioinformatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics). See [Teaching Bioinformatics at the Secondary School Level](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002242) and [Ten Simple Rules for Teaching Bioinformatics at the High School Level](https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002243) and. The [yourgenome function finder](http://www.yourgenome.org/activities/function-finders) is a good way of demonstrating how DNA sequences code for proteins

* **Maths** Lots of scope for supporting and augmenting teaching mathematics using computers, for examples see the [scratchmaths.org](http://www.scratchmaths.org)

* **Geography**  Weather station https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/weather-station-guide and https://www.raspberrypi.org/education/weather-station/ looking at data see [urbandataschool.com](https://www.urbandataschool.com)


## Education, education, education

Classroom management and behaviour management, we don't provide any training on how to become a teacher because but.. pgce, one of the best way to learn is to do it and get feedback from experts (teachers in schools)

* See [Nine things every teacher should know](https://www.tes.com/us/news/breaking-views/9-things-every-teacher-should-know) by [Dylan Wiliam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_Wiliam), Emeritus Professor of Education at the University of London is a good place to start

If you are interested in primary school, take a look at [Code Club](https://www.codeclub.org.uk), [barefootcas.org.uk]( https://barefootcas.org.uk) and [QuickStart Computing](https://community.computingatschool.org.uk/resources/3042)

Even if you are working with secondary school students, it can be beneficial to visit a primary school (for example, one that feeds into your secondary school) to get the bigger picture on education as a whole.

## Further reading
* The [Roehampton Annual Computing Education Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1xf_L-jCIzYZmZDbFAzb3BPUEk/view) (published annually in December) gives a good overview of the state of computing in the UK. Read the (executive summary)[http://milesberry.net/2016/12/the-roehampton-annual-computing-education-report-2015/] to get a flavour, it answers basic questions like how many people are taking GCSE Computing compared to other subjects? How is participation in Computer Science across different ages, genders and geographical regions?
* Many of the ideas above have been around a while, see the classic book by [Seymour Papert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seymour_Papert) (1980) [Mindstorms: children, computers, and powerful ideas](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1095592)  


* Professor [Mark Guzdial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Guzdial) is Professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology and writes a blog at [computinged.wordpress.com](https://computinged.wordpress.com). His technique known as [MediaComputation.org](http://coweb.cc.gatech.edu/mediaComp-teach) introduces  computing using themes of manipulating media (images, sound and video). See Using Learning Sciences Research to Improve Computing Teaching (CAS) and his book

* Look at past reports from final year students (search for projects supervised by "Duncan Hull") on the [Selected recommended final year project reports](https://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/resources/library/3rd-year-project.php?view=ug)
