# Getting started on your computing education projects

If you are starting a [final year project in computer science eduation](https://goo.gl/z9Hs9x), here are some useful resources to help you make a flying start in September and keep you going throughout the academic year. You can link directly to this document using [http://git.io/computinged](git.io/computinged)

## Joining in
If you haven't already, join [computingatschool.org.uk](Computing At School (CAS)). CAS is UK network of teachers of computing in primary and secondary schools with lots of free resources available that you can re-use and extend, see [http://community.computingatschool.org.uk/sign_up](community.computingatschool.org.uk/sign_up)

its useful if you don't already have it, to get DBS cleared. This provides evidence to the school that it is safe for them to let you work with children and young people (e.g. not a criminal). One of the easiest wasy to do this is sign up as a STEM ambassador https://www.stem.org.uk/stem-ambassadors/ambassadors


## Planning and thinking about your project in advance

Like many research projects, your final year education project is open-ended. Unlike lectures and exams, you have much more scope for driving the project in a direction you want, with help and guidance from your academic supervisors, the teachers in your school and the students and pupils you are working with. In previous years, undergraduate student projects have typically been one of the following kinds:

1.** DEVELOPMENT FOR STUDENTS ** Creating an artefact or artefacts (e.g. software, hardware, lesson plans & resources) to help students understand different aspects of computer science
2. ** DEVELOPMENT FOR TEACHERS ** Creating an artefact or artefacts that helps teachers to teach and assess computer Science including what they have understood or misunderstood
3. ** RESEARCH Evaluating different pedagogical methodologies for teaching a given topic. For example, you might want to find out which kind of language is best for students learning about loops. Are text-based languages (like Python or Java) better or worse than block based languages (Like [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) and [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly)) See the latest research in computer science education in schools via Sue Sentance at Kings College London & Neil Brown at the University of Kent http://community.computingatschool.org.uk/files/8842/original.pptx

These categories are not exclusive, so you might do one or several of these together using the same tool.

## Essential reading and resources

You really need to look at these:

* Subscribe to [Hello World magazine](https://helloworld.raspberrypi.org/helloworld). Electronic copies  are free, but as an educator you can also sign up to have a glossy printed copy of the magazine sent to your postal address. The [https://www.raspberrypi.org/magpi/](MagPi magazine) from the Raspberry Pi Foundation is similar,  though covers broader themes education alongside the frequently updated [Raspberry Pi blog](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/)

* [Shut down or restart?](https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/computing-in-schools/report/) was a landmark report led by Professor [Steve Furber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Furber) here in the School of Computer Science in 2012. Its a good overview of some of the problems facing computing education, that is part of the [Computing education at the Royal Society] (https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/computing-education/) activity. In september of 2017, Steve will also publish a major survey of computing education in schools https://royalsociety.org/news/2016/10/launch-computing-education-schools-survey/

* CAS Tenderfoot is a Google-funded project that trains [Key Stage 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_Stage_3) teachers. Their training notes have loads of good ideas for teaching everything from finite state machines to going beyond simple algorithms, see
[CAS Tenderfoot](https://www.computingatschool.org.uk/custom_pages/148-tft-available)

* GCSE Computing. Even if you're not teaching GCSE Computer Science, it is useful to be able to understand what GCSE computing is all about as some of your students may be opting to take it in the future. See BBC Bite Size, http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/subjects/z34k7ty and Cambridge GCSE Computing https://www.cambridgegcsecomputing.org
* An overview of the Computer Science curriculum in secondary schools http://www.computingatschool.org.uk/data/uploads/ComputingCurric.pdf
* [Project Quantum](https://diagnosticquestions.com/Quantum) provides a lots of high-quality

## General news
Education, and computing education, is frequently discussed in the mainstream media see e.g. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education and e.g. [Computing in schools - alarm bells over England's classes](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-40322796)

## SHINY NEW TOOLS!

Taking hardware into the classroom that students have never seen before is a good way to spark interest. If you have time before the project, you can experiment with new hardware that you could use in the classroom. We have lots of kit you can use in the [hardware library](http://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/ugt/hardware/?view=ug) like:

teaching resources from raspberry pi https://www.raspberrypi.org/resources/teach/
physical computing https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/announcing-our-new-online-training-series/
microbits http://microbit.org/

[Oculus Rift](https://www.oculus.com)

## Computing without computers
Fancy hardware and gadgets are great ways to engage children, but you don't always need it. You can inspire people's imagination about computer science without using a computer at all. Some good examples:

* [Computer Science unplugged](http://csunplugged.org) from Tim Bell at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand is a Google funded project
* See [Computing Without Computers: A Gentle Introduction to Computer Programming, Data Structures and Algorithms](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~pc/research/education/puzzles/reading/cwcch13.pdf) by [Paul Curzon](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~pc/) at Queen Mary University of London and his accompanying Computer Science for Fun website and magazine at [cs4fn.org](http://www.cs4fn.org)
* A key part of Computer Science education is computational thinking https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_thinking. For your projects, think about how you can encourage computational thinking in your classrooms


## Primary education
If you are interested in primary school, take a look at [Code Club](https://www.codeclub.org.uk), [barefootcas.org.uk]( https://barefootcas.org.uk) and [QuickStart Computing](https://community.computingatschool.org.uk/resources/3042)

Even if you are working with secondary school students, it can be beneficial to visit a primary school (for example, one that feeds into your secondary school) to get the bigger picture on computing in education as a whole.

## Further reading
* The [Roehampton Annual Computing Education Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1xf_L-jCIzYZmZDbFAzb3BPUEk/view) (published December 2016) gives a good overview of the state of computing in the UK. E.g. how many people are taking GCSE Computing compared to other subjects? How is participation in Computer Science across different ages, genders and geographical regions?
* Many of the ideas above have been around a while, see the book by Seymour Papert (1980) Mindstorms: children, computers, and powerful ideas http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1095592 (free pdf)
