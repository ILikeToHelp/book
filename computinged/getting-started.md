# getting a head start on your computing education projects

If you're starting a final year project, here are some useful resources to help you make a flying start in September and keep you going throughout the academic year.

## Joining in
join Computing At School (if you haven't already), this is UK network of teachers of computing in primary and secondary schools with lots of free resources available that you can re-use and extend http://community.computingatschool.org.uk/sign_up

its useful if you don't already have it, to get DBS cleared. This provides evidence to the school that it is safe for them to let you work with children and young people (e.g. not a criminal). One of the easiest wasy to do this is sign up as a STEM ambassador https://www.stem.org.uk/stem-ambassadors/ambassadors


## Planning and thinking about your project in advance

Like many research projects, your final year education project is open-ended. Unlike lectures and exams, you have much more scope for driving the project in a direction you want, with help and guidance from your academic supervisors, the teachers in your school and the students and pupils you are working with. In previous years, undergraduate student projects have typically been one of the following kinds:

1. DEVELOPMENT TYPE A Creating an artefact or artefacts (e.g. software, hardware, lesson plans & resources) to help students understand different aspects of computer science
2. DEVELOPMENT TYPE B Creating an artefact or artefacts that helps teachers assess what their pupils have understood (or misunderstood) about computer Science
3. RESEARCH Evaluating different pedagogical methodologies for teaching a given topic. For example, you might want to find out which kind of language is best for students learning about loops. Are text-based languages (like Python or Java) better or worse than block based languages (Like [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) and [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly)) See the latest research in computer science education in schools via Sue Sentance at Kings College London & Neil Brown at the University of Kent http://community.computingatschool.org.uk/files/8842/original.pptx

These categories are not exclusive, so you might do A and B together using the same tool. It is worth thinking about the kind of project you'd like to do

##Essential reading and resources

You really need to look at these:

* Subscribe to Hello World magazine, https://helloworld.raspberrypi.org/helloworld. PDFs are free, but as an educator you can sign up to have a printed copy of the magazine sent to your postal address. The Magpi magazine from the Raspberry Pi Foundation is similar https://www.raspberrypi.org/magpi/ though covers broader themes education

* [Shut down or restart](https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/computing-in-schools/report/) was a landmark report led by Professor [Steve Furber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Furber) here in the School of Computer Science in 2012. Its a good overview of some of the problems facing computing education, that is part of the [Computing education at the Royal Society] (https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/computing-education/) activity. In september of 2017, Steve will also publish a major survey of computing education in schools https://royalsociety.org/news/2016/10/launch-computing-education-schools-survey/

* CAS Tenderfoot is a Google-funded project that trains key stage 3 teachers. Their training notes have lots of good ideas for teaching everything from finite state machines to going beyond simple algorithms, see
[CAS Tenderfoot](https://www.computingatschool.org.uk/custom_pages/148-tft-available)

* GCSE Computing. Regardless of if you're teaching GCSE or not, its useful to be able to understand what GCSE computing is all about as some of your students may be opting to take it in the future. See BBC Bite Size, http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/subjects/z34k7ty and Cambridge GCSE Computing https://www.cambridgegcsecomputing.org

## General news
Education, and computing education, is frequently discussed in the mainstream media see e.g. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education and e.g. [Computing in schools - alarm bells over England's classes](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-40322796)

## Experiment with new hardware that you could use in the classroom:

## Computing without computers
Fancy hardware and gadgets are great ways to engage children, but you don't always need it. You can inspire people's imagination about computer science without using a computer at all. Some good examples

* Computer Science unplugged http://csunplugged.org/

* See [Computing Without Computers: A Gentle Introduction to Computer Programming, Data Structures and Algorithms](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~pc/research/education/puzzles/reading/cwcch13.pdf) by [Paul Curzon](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~pc/) at Queen Mary University of London and his accompanying Computer Science 4 Fun website and magazine [cs4fn.org](http://www.cs4fn.org)

## Just for primary
If you are interested in primary school, Take a look at Code Club and https://www.codeclub.org.uk and barefoot computing https://barefootcas.org.uk/ and QuickStart Computing  https://community.computingatschool.org.uk/resources/3042

Even if you are working with secondary school students, it can be beneficial to visit a primary school (for example, one that feeds into your secondary school)

## Further reading
* The Roehampton Annual Computing Education Report gives a good overview of the state of computing in the UK. E.g. how many people are taking GCSE Computing compared to other subjects? How is participation in Computer Science across different ages, genders and geographical regions?
