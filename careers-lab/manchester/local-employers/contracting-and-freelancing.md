Finding freelance and contract work as a software Engineering


There are many

TopTal https://www.toptal.com - You need to interview to get invited to join the network
UpWork https://www.upwork.com Can be quite heavy on fees but lots of leads
Freelancer https://www.freelancer.co.uk/- A lot of (overseas) competition, but still plenty of work

The key to getting contract / freelance work via these website is to get good reviews

You could start out by offering low prices and bidding on smaller projects to get a good reputation before starting to focus on larger, higher paid projects.

To find projects where you can work directly with the client (without going through a broker or agent), a good place to start is attending meetups in Manchester and go along with some business cards. Organisations like  http://technw.uk/calendar, http://www.meetup.com, http://lanyrd.com and http://www.eventbrite.co.uk are all good places to start looking
