Employers in Manchester that recruit Computer Scientists
========================================================
This page (Shortcut url [git.io/manc](http://git.io/manc) part of [git.io/mycv](http://git.io/mycv)) lists organisations in (and around) Manchester that employ Computer Science students, either before or after graduation. This is a partial list of what some people call the [Northern Powerhouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Powerhouse). This is by no means a comprehensive list, but will give you a quick flavour of employers in the North West. See for example [The top 100 tech companies in Greater Manchester 2017](http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/business/business-news/top-tech-companies-manchester-north-13716704), as judged by the Manchester Evening News.

## Not Just London

You don't **have** to move to London to find top employers, there are plenty located here in the North West if you'd like to stick around after you graduate. It is often argued that [Manchester offers a better quality of life than London](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/jul/07/manchester-offers-best-quality-of-life-for-young-graduates-says-report) we couldn't possible comment other than to say its [horses for courses](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/horses_for_courses). The North West Tech Community calendar [@technwuk](https://twitter.com/technwuk), provides a window on (and networking opportunities with) many of employers based in the North West [techw.uk](http://technw.uk) if you want to find out more.
