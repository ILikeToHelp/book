# Debugging your CV / Résumé

This guide is based on common bugs we've seen in the School of Computer Science with students CVs (aka Résumés) in the CV Bank at the University of Manchester. If you've had your CV assessed and it is covered in red ink, please don't take it personally. This is probably the first CV you've written, think of it as version 0.1 (beta release). There are many chances to debug and improve it. Find out more at http://www.careers.manchester.ac.uk/applicationsinterviews/cv/ and http://man.ac.uk/6Ef90a

## Education (ED)

This should usually be the first section, as it is the most recent and important thing about you, unless you have LOTS of work experience.

  1. **OUTLINE** Give an outline of what you have studied in your degree. For example saying “BSc in Computer Science” is too vague and ambiguous. What have you studied? Include courses that you will be doing in the future, as well as ones you have already done. By the time you get the interview, you'll be able to say more about them. What exactly does YOUR Computer Science degree mean? Add some brief context... Just saying “BSc Computer Science” is not enough, there are thousands of undergraduate courses in computer science and they are all very different - so spell it out in detail.
  2. **TOO MUCH**... but don't list every single module you've done - just summarise the courses that are relevant to the job, the ones you found interesting or excelled at
  3. **AVERAGE** Give an overall degree classification e.g “first year average, 65%, 2:1” but don't list every mark for every course. Long lists of marks are usually a waste of space and tedious for the person reading it, unless you want to highlight exceptional performance in particular modules you have studied. Whatever mark you're describe, two significant figures is enough e.g. don't say “68.71% overall mark” - just “68% average mark” will do
  4. **AIMING HIGHER** If you hope that your degree classification will improve, state what your achieved grade and expected grades are - they might be different (e.g. expected grade: first class)
  5. **SUMMARISE** Instead of listing EVERY secondary / high school qualification, summarise them briefly e.g. “13 GCSE's A*-A including Maths and English”. These exams were important when you were 16, but are much less relevant now so don't waste space with a detailed description
  6. **DATES** The description of your degree should include a start date and (expected) end date (year). Don't includes days, and only include months where they are relevant (e.g. summer jobs)
  7. **FIRST YEAR TEAM PROJECT** Mention the name of the project, what it did and what your role was e.g. *Mancshacks: built an accommodation finder for students in Manchester that worked both on mobile and web platforms, organised a team of 6 students meeting once a week over 12 months, see http://www.mancshacks.com*. No-one outside the Kilburn building will understand what you mean if you say “first year team project”. What skills did you gain while doing it (not just tech skills)? What role did you play in the team?

## Experience (EX) and Projects

This is usually the second section on the first page, unless you have lots of experience. If you don't have much experience to talk about, you can emphasise project work, both inside and outside of education.

  1. **DETAILS** Make sure the duration, company name and location of any experience you have is described. If you have lots of experience and projects, choose the ones that are most relevant to the job you are applying for
  2. **VOLUNTEER?** Include voluntary work (as well as paid work), e.g. Teacher, PASS leader, Student Ambassador, etc
  3. **EXPLAIN** Saying “first year team project” won't mean much to people outside the Kilburn building.
  4. **TINKERING** Include projects you've worked in your own time, have you ever built anything in your spare time? What about that Raspberry Pi / Arduino home automation project? If you've contributed to any open source software projects, you should DEFINITELY mention them. It doesn't have to be just code, it could be testing, bug reports, documentation, asking/answering questions (e.g. on stackoverflow etc)
  5. **NO EXPERIENCE** Don't have any experience? Voluntary work is a good way to pick some experience up. It is never too late to volunteer http://manchester.ac.uk/volunteers or become a student ambassador http://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/volunteering/ Volunteering doesn't have to involve computing either, anything that demonstrates soft skills is worth mentioning

## Skills (SK)

List your skills, providing evidence and context where you can.

  1. **AWSUM SKILLZ** List your relevant technical skills. You could classify them into (for example) languages, operating sytems, frameworks, front/back-end, hardware, tools and specific software applications. The classification you use will depend on the job you're applying for. A web developer role will require a different emphasis to a DevOps / sysadmin role. Likewise, if you want to design integrated circuits and other hardware, your CV will look very different from a CS student going for [Business Analyst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_analyst) roles.
  2. **NOT JUST A TECHIE** Remember you have other (soft) skills too. These are just important as your hard skills, so don't forget to mention them.
  3. **EXPERT OR BEGINNER?** It can sometimes be useful to classify your technical skills by the level of experience (beginner, intermediate, expert) or how long you've been using them (1 week, 1 year, 10 years etc). It's also useful to say a little bit about what you've used them for, as its all to easy to list skills you don't actually have.
  4. **PRINCIPLES** Don't forget to mention fundamental principles (the science bit) you have learned as well as specific tools (the engineering & technology bit). Technologies come and go very fast - it is the principles you have learned  on your degree that will set you up for your career for many years to come. Fundamental concepts in Computer Science like architecture, OOP, algorithms, design patterns, operating systems, security and networks don't change as quickly as the technology does - so make sure you mention them.
  5. **META** As a computer science student, you also have demonstrable “meta” skills like the ability to learn things quickly  - either on your own as an [autodidact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodidacticism) or from others. You can also think logically, reason, problem solve, analyse and abstract. Again, these are future proof skills that will last longer than whatever technology is fashionable right now. Employers are often more interested in these “meta” capabilities and your potential than in specific technical skills.


## Personal Details (PD)

How to get in touch

  1. **ADDRESS** PushedForSpace? Consider leaving out your postal address as an email address and phone number are usually sufficient, first contact from a prospective employer is unlikely to be by post. Some people put personal details last (with references), as they aren't the most important thing about you. Another option is to have them in the header or footer, if you have space, so that they are on every page.
  2. **THIS IS A CV (WELL DUH!)** Don't include the title RESUME or CURRICULUM VITAE. It will be obvious to the reader that the document is a CV/Resume, saying so is usually a waste of valuable space. The title of the document should be YOUR NAME big, bold and simple. E.g. just “ALAN TURING” not “CURRICULUM VITAE ALAN TURING”.
  3. **DATE OF BIRTH** You don't need to include your date of birth on your CV - your age should not be relevant to your job application. Also, publicising your birth date widely *could* make you more vulnerable to identity theft, see the [dangers of revealing your date of birth](http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/95029/how-dangerous-is-it-to-reveal-your-date-of-birth-and-why) for example.
  4. **MUGSHOT?** It is unusual to put a photo of yourself on your CV. What you look like should not be a factor in your job application.
  5. **MARRIAGE & GENDER** Your marital status & gender should not be relevant to your job application either
  6. **MYDOMAIN.COM** The email address me@mydomain.com says more than just how to contact you, it shows that you know how to setup an email server and a web server. Make sure you mention your personal domain and email if you have one. It can give a better impression than a generic me@hotmail.com or me@gmail.com.

## Formatting (FM)

It is really important to get the formatting of your CV right so that it looks professional.

  1. **WASTE OF SPACE** Space is very valuable, you should use every pixel, millimetre and word to maximum effect. If there are big blank spaces this can look bad - fill space by providing more detail, increasing the font size, line spacing (e.g. 1.5 line spacing) or reducing margins & etc. Make sure you use all the vertical and horizontal space available (but leave reasonable sized margins)
  2. **CRAMPING YOUR STYLE** It can be tempting to cram things on - but this makes it hard to read if the text is too small. Rather than list EVERYTHING you've done EVER, show the most important or relevant aspects.
  3. **BLANK SPACE** Make sure you use all the space available, both vertical and horizontal. Two pages is the norm for a CV, though some employers ask for a one pager. You shouldn't have blank space on either type. It can be useful to have both a one-page and two-page version at the ready.
  4. **PDF** The Portable Document Format is a more idiot-proof way to distribute documents than Word files, and PDF works on more platforms and devices. Beware of converting Word to PDF, it can be an unpredictable and lossy conversion which messes up fonts, page breaks and other important formatting. Some employers will use software that won't accept PDFs, and will insist on Word. Thankfully they are not too common.
  5. **MICROSOFT / GOOGLE** Word, Google Docs and other word processors are OK, if that is what you are most comfortable with. However,using LaTeX can make your CV stand out because the typography is usually much better. Some formatting can be painful to do in LaTeX, but it is in most applications. There are BLTs (Beautiful Latex Templates) available from [overleaf.com](https://www.overleaf.com/gallery/tagged/cv) and [sharelatex.com](https://www.sharelatex.com/templates/cv-or-resume) if you don't like using a text editor to write LaTeX. Plenty of good templates are available elsewhere  [google.com/search?q=latex+cv+template](https://www.google.com/search?q=latex+cv+template).
  6. **STYLE** Don't underestimate the importance of style, formatting and typography. Badly formatted CVs will end up in the bin. Formatting can be tedious, labour intensive and time consuming, but it is worth spending the time to get it right. Use a template if it helps, see for example Bryn's CV http://bryn.co.uk/CV.pdf. Bryn is a third year student in Computer Science on placement at Google during 2015/6.
  7. **AVOID UNDERLINE** Underline was designed for typewriters and should usually be avoided. Sometimes it's OK to use underline for hyperlinks, as it helps to show that they are clickable URLs. Fixed width fonts look pretty horrible too (for example URLs in LaTeX). Look at any professional document, it is very unlikely that you will find underline or fixed width fonts.
  8. **PRINT** Print out your CV to check what it actually looks like. Can you read it? Odd things can happen that make your CV look rubbish, so it is worth trying out a few different printers. Does it fit nicely on two pages? Are there any nasty page and line breaks that create ugly [widowed & orphaned text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widows_and_orphans)? If you're using a fancy looking font, bear in mind that it might not work on all devices and printers. You might need to investigate [embedding the fonts in the pdf](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=embed+fonts+pdf) to prevent any [font substitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Font_substitution) spoiling your hard work.
  9. **BAD PAGE BREAKS** splitting sections across pages is usually a bad idea and can waste space. If you have to split a section, make sure the title follows it. e.g. “EXPERIENCE (continued)”
  10. **BAD LINE BREAKS** take care that the line breaks occur in sensible places, if necessary, adjust the text so it fits better into the space available. Bad line breaks waste valuable

  space and make it harder to read the document - they distract the reader from what you are saying.
  11. **TABULATE** Tables can be a good way to arrange information, but they usually look better, cleaner and easier to read WITHOUT a border

## Structure (ST)

The order and structure of your CV is as important as the content

  1. **FIRST THINGS FIRST** The first page should usually be Education and Experience (usually in that order), second page page all the other stuff. Order with the most important (or recent) things first. It is debateable if your personal details should go front and top. Is your postal address *REALLY* the most important thing about you? Does it deserve prime space at the top of your CV? Many people put personal details at the end  - often just email and telephone no. for first contact. You're unlikely to be posted anything until much later in the job application process.
  2. **REVERSE** Reverse chronological order is normal, (most recent first) and it is often the easiest way to structure your CV. Within each section, order likewise, most important (or relevant) work experience goes at the top of that section and so on

## General (GEN)

Some general points that apply to all sections of your CV

  1. **HYPER LINKING** It is good to have *some* links, preferably clickable URLs, in your PDF. Link to anything you have that adds context to what you're saying e.g. company websites, your personal website, LinkedIn, GitHub, BitBucket, Stackoverflow profile, any project URLs, hackathon / competition URLs  (without overlinking). If you have a LinkedIn profile, make sure you [customise and shorten your LinkedIn url] (https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=custom+linkedin+url) it will look much better than the default alphanumeric string used to identify you. P.S. If you've not used LinkedIn before, it's like social media for grown ups - where people talk about employment and jobs.
  2. **KNOW WHAT I MEAN?** Don't assume the person reading your CV knows what you're talking about. It's a classic mistake to make when writing.
  3. **UNDERSELL** a CV is no place for modesty - it is a professional advert for you - to sell what you have to a prospective employer so that they invite you to interview. Don't hide your light under a bushel!
  4. **ACTIVE LANGAGE** Starting sentences with VERBS can often help, see the “Active Language List” described in http://man.ac.uk/6Ef90a Don't make the reader trawl through long pieces of prose to find out more, bullets are usually easier to scan and digest. Your CV will be assessed in seconds or minutes, the reader won't have time to read your life story - they are just trying to decide if they should interview your or not.
  5. **OVERSELL** but don't oversell by exaggerating or being deceptive about your achievements - it is easy to spot and check up on. Some employers have very rigorous background checks, so honesty is the best policy. If one inconsistency is found in your CV, however trivial, you could be rejected.
  6. **QUANTIFY** improve any claims you make by adding numbers. For example, instead of saying “won prize for best student in year” you could say “won prize for best student in year (out of 200 in total)”
  7. **EXPAND** Expand abbreviations where you have space. For example, not everyone reading your CV will know what PASS stands for
  8. **ME ME ME ME ME ME ME** Your CV is all about you, but you should be careful to avoid using “I, me, My” too much as it can look self-centered. One way of avoiding this is to put the verb first, so instead of saying “I developed a system for improving logistics” you can say “developed a system for improving logistics”. Its OK to have a few “I's” in there,  and it is difficulty to avoid in a personal statement, but too many I's can look bad.
  9. **SPILLING and GRAMMAR** Bad spelling and dodgy grammar looks awful. Use a spell checker. Proof read the document. Proof read it again. Then proof read it again.
  10. **PROVE IT** It is very easy to make statements without backing them up with evidence or context. Wherever you can, try to avoid making unsupported claims e.g. “I am an excellent team worker” or “I am a Java expert”. Anyone can SAY this, how can you PROVE it? Don't tell me, show me. When did you work in a team? What did you use Java for?

## Hobbies and interests (HOB)

Hobbies reveal some of your personality, which is what employers really care about

  1. **ANYONE FOR QUIDDITCH?** Hobbies aren't just an afterthought - it is an opportunity to stamp your personality on your CV and add a bit of colour to what can be a rather dry and factual document. Hobbies can be talking points for the interview, or make you stand out. Hobbies can be an icebreaker if you're fortunate enough to share interests with your interview panel. Don't have any hobbies? Really? There's 500 different societies to choose from in [Manchester Student's Union](http://manchesterstudentsunion.com) (including [Quidditch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quidditch) see [quidditch club](http://manchesterstudentsunion.com/groups/quidditch-club))
  2. **MEMBER?** If you are involved in activities or societies say what your role is. By itself, what does “member” actually mean - a bit vague. You can be a member without doing anything. Were you a treasurer? Partipant? Organiser? Leader? Publicist? Secretary? Hacker? Hanger-on? Beer-drinker? Rabble rouser? Advocate? Trouble-maker? See ACTIVE LANGUAGE.
  3. **COMPUTING?** Is computing also your hobby? Don't be ashamed if it is, as it demonstrates your commitment and enthusiasm to the subject beyond just getting a degree.

## References (REF)

The last thing on your CV

  1. **ON REQUEST** Usually you can just say “references available on request” rather than listing all your referees. If you have space, listing your referees will make it easier for the employer as they won't need to contact you again to get them, but most people won't have space to include them. Also by saying “on request” you know when the references will be taken up (because you'll be notified) so you have more control over the process.
  2. **ASK YOUR REFEREES** Make sure you check with your referees before references are taken up (often after your interview), its good to have a mixture of referees from different places if you can (e.g. Employers, University tutors etc) and you obviously need to be confident that they will write you a good reference.

## Next steps

What to do next:

* **RELEASE OFTEN** Having [released your CV early, keep releasing it often](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_early,_release_often). According to [Linus's (Torvald's) Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_Law) ''*given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow*''. So the more people who see your CV, the more bugs you can squash. Do a CV swap and peer-review with a fellow student (if you haven't already). Show it to your friends, family and personal tutor etc. The more people who see it, the better it will get. You can apply many of the the principles of [agile software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) to your CV.
* **IMPROVING** See five steps to take next: Explore, Connect, Communicate, Reflect and Apply http://www.careers.manchester.ac.uk/myfuture/ and mid-degree advice (for 2nd years)  http://www.careers.manchester.ac.uk/middegree/ from the careers service
* **RE-CHECK** Have another look at the CV and LinkedIn guide from the careers service http://man.ac.uk/6Ef90a there is good advice mentioned there that is not in this guide
* **UPLOAD** Upload an updated version to the CV bank once you've changed it https://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/employment/industryclub/cvbank
* **REJECTION** It is hard work finding a job, most people will make many unsuccessful job applications and interviews before finding something they like. Coping with rejection is routine part of applying for jobs. Keep trying and aim to get better each time, learning from your mistakes rather than repeating them.

Good luck with your applications and interviews. If you need any help contact Mabel, the careers service or myself. I'm happy to give more feedback on improved versions of your CV in the future.
