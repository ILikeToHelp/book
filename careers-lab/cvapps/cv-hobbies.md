## Colouring it

Hobbies reveal some of your personality, which is often what employers are really trying to find out.

1. **JOIN IT** Hobbies aren't just an afterthought - it is an opportunity to stamp your personality on your CV and add a bit of colour to what can be a dry and factual document. Hobbies can be talking points for the interview, or make you stand out. They can also break the ice if you are fortunate enough to share interests with your interview panel. You might not have lots of spare time outside of study, but there is much more to university that just getting a degree. For example, there are ~500 different societies you could get involved in at [Manchester Student's Union](http://manchesterstudentsunion.com) alone. Anyone for [Quidditch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quidditch)? See the [quidditch club](http://manchesterstudentsunion.com/groups/quidditch-club))
2. **CONTEXTUALISE IT** If you are involved in activities or societies you should explain your role in the group. By itself, being a “member” or even “active member” of a group is very vague, you can be a member of a society without doing anything. Were you a treasurer? Partipant? Organiser? Leader? Publicist? Secretary? Hacker? Hanger-on? Beer-drinker? Rabble rouser? Advocate? Trouble-maker? See also [git.io/verbsfirst](http://git.io/verbsfirst)
3. **COMPUTE IT** Is computing also your hobby? Don't be ashamed if it is. While it is important to have a work-life balance, if computing is your hobby (as well as your degree and day job) it shows commitment and enthusiasm to the subject beyond education. This is a good thing. In Computer Science, everyday is [geek pride day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geek_Pride_Day)!
