## Structuring

The order and structure of your CV is as important as the content and styling

  1. **FIRST THINGS FIRST** The first page should usually be Education and Experience (usually in that order), second page page all the other stuff. Order with the most important (or recent) things first. It is debateable if your personal details should go front and top. Is your postal address *REALLY* the most important thing about you? Does it deserve prime space at the top of your CV? Many people put personal details at the end  - often just email and telephone no. for first contact. If a company really needs to post you something, they can contact you by phone or email to get your snail mail address.
  2. **REVERSE** Reverse chronological order is normal, (most recent first) and it is often the easiest way to structure your CV. Within each section, order likewise, most important (or relevant) work experience goes at the top of that section and so on
