# Describing your skills

This section [git.io/mycvsk](http://git.io/mycvsk) is part of [git.io/mycv](http://git.io/mycv)

## Skills

List your skills, providing evidence and context where you can.

  1. **AWSUM SKILLZ** List your relevant technical skills. You could classify them into (for example) programming languages, operating systems, frameworks, front/back-end, hardware, tools and specific software applications. The classification you use will depend on the job you're applying for. A [software engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineer) or [web developer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_developer) role will require a different emphasis to a [DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) / [sysadmin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_administrator) role. Likewise, if your calling in life is to design integrated circuits, your CV will look very different from a Computer Science student going for [Business Analyst (BA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_analyst), [Data Scientist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science), [Technical Analyst](https://www.glassdoor.co.uk/Salaries/technical-analyst-salary-SRCH_KO0,17.htm), [User Experience Design (UXD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience_design) or [Project Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_manager) roles.
  2. **POPULAR LANGUAGES** Did you mention all of the popular languages you have used? See, for example, the [The 2016 Top Programming Languages](http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/the-2016-top-programming-languages) and the [PYPL PopularitY of Programming Language](http://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html)
  3. **COMP234** If you're doing [COMP23420 Software Engineering](https://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/ugt/COMP23420/syllabus/) you could mention for example that your second year project involves building a multi-user, multi-threaded, client-server application with 6000 Java classes, 1800 JUnit test cases and over 10 years of commit history. As part of your project you are using tools like [Eclipse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse_(software)), [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git), [Apache Ant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Ant), [Jenkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenkins_(software)), [Gerrit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrit_(software)) and [SonarQube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SonarQube) to help you manage issue tracking, code quality, build automation, test automation and version control.
  4. **MORE THAN A TECHIE** Remember you have [soft skills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_skills) as well as your technical skills. These are just important as your hard skills, so don't forget to mention them. Negotiation, leadership, conflict resolution, communication, presenting, writing & mentoring etc -  all important.
  5. **EXPERT OR BEGINNER?** It can sometimes be useful to classify your technical skills by the level of experience (beginner, intermediate, expert) or how long you've been using them (1 week, 1 year, 10 years etc). It's also essential to say a bit about what you've used them for, as its all to easy to list skills you don't actually have.
  6. **PRINCIPLES: SCIENCE & ENGINEERING** Don't forget to mention fundamental principles (the science) you have learned as well as specific tools (the engineering & technology). Technologies come and go very fast - it is the principles you have learned  on your degree that will set you up for your career for many years to come. Fundamental concepts in Computer Science like architecture, OOP, algorithms, design patterns, operating systems, security and networks don't change as quickly as the technology does - so make sure you mention them. As Computer Science students, you are both and engineer AND a scientist, that's two degrees for the price of one!
  7. **META** As a computer scientist, you also have demonstrable “meta” skills like the ability to learn things quickly  - either [self-taught](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodidacticism) or learning from peers. You can also think logically, reason, problem solve, analyse and abstract - often to tight deadlines. Again, these are future-proof skills that will last longer than whatever technology is fashionable right now. Employers are often more interested in these “meta” capabilities and your potential than in specific technical skills.
