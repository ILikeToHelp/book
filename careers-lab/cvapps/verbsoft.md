# Verbs for emphasising what you've done

This section [git.io/verbsfirst](http://git.io/verbsfirst) is part of the debugging your CV guide at [git.io/mycv](http://git.io/mycv) .

A simple but effective technique for emphasising what you have done, rather than just what you know is to start the description of it with a verb. Many employers (members of [our industry club](http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/industry/club/)) have told us that they don't just want to know what graduates **know**, but what graduates have actually **done**. So, for example, instead of saying e.g.

* “*In my second year software engineering module I used Java, Eclipse and JUnit to test and build an open source Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG) called Stendhal ([stendhalgame.org](http://www.stendhalgame.org))*”

you could say:

* “*Built and tested an open source Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG) called Stendhal ([stendhalgame.org](http://www.stendhalgame.org)) using Eclipse, Java, JUnit and ... etc*”

This also avoids the problem of using “*I, me, my*” too much which can sound self-centred and egotistical. The CV and LinkedIn guide from the Careers Service [http://man.ac.uk/6Ef90a](http://man.ac.uk/6Ef90a) has a list of  verbs you can use on page 10 for emphasising different skills. The verbs listed below are particularly useful for describing your software engineering and problem solving skills:

# Verbs for describing software engineering

You might find these useful:

* added (e.g. new features)
* analysed (e.g. the requirements)
* architected
* assigned (e.g. bugs to team members)
* augmented
* automated (e.g. automated tests and builds)
* awarded (e.g. at a hackathon or competition)
* branched (e.g. git branch)
* built
* cloned (e.g. git clone)
* committed (e.g. git -commit)
* configured
* debugged (e.g. in [brownfield software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownfield_(software_development)))
* developed
* designed (e.g. in [greenfield software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenfield_project))
* devised
* deployed
* documented
* engineered
* enhanced
* ensured (e.g. quality)
* estimated (e.g. how long it would take, remember that [cost estimation is hard](http://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/60994/why-is-software-schedule-estimation-so-hard) and therefore a valuable skill)
* experimented (e.g. with a new API for example)
* fixed (a bug or bugs)
* gathered (requirements)
* hacked (an [overloaded term](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacking), be careful!)
* implemented (e.g. an algorithm)
* improved (but remember to quantify)
* installed
* integrated
* interfaced
* merged (e.g. git merge)
* modified (e.g. stendhal)
* modded (e.g. in gaming terminology)
* navigated (e.g. a complex codebase)
* patched
* prioritised (e.g. which bugs/features are most important)
* proposed (e.g. a new application)
* prototyped
* pulled (e.g. git pull)
* pushed (e.g. git push)
* queried (e.g. database)
* rebased (e.g. https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/rewriting-history/)
* refactored
* repurposed
* reused
* reviewed (e.g. code review)
* rewrote
* secured
* solved
* tested
* understood (e.g. code comprehension)
* verified
* validated
