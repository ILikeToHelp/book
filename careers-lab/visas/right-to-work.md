If you are studying in the UK and have come from outside the European Union, your right to work in the UK will depend on your visa and the employer. There are two visas that are relevant:


  1. As of 2015, **Tier 4 visas** https://www.gov.uk/tier-4-general-visa/overview allow you to work full time in the UK, provided that the work is part of your study. Doing an industrial experience year is an assessed part of your study which means that if you hold a Tier 4 visa, you have the right to work full-time in the UK.
  2. As of 2015 **Tier 2 visas** https://www.gov.uk/tier-2-general/overview allow you to work in the UK *after* you graduate. Not all organisations are [licensed sponsors of Tier 2 visas](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/472977/2015-11-02_Tier_25_Register_of_Sponsors.pdf), so if you want to work in the UK after you graduate, you need to apply to companies that are listed as Tier 2 sponsors. Applying to other organisations is likely to be a waste of your time, because they won't be able to sponsor a Tier 2 visa that is required for you to work in the UK.
